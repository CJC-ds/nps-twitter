# nps-twitter
Net promoter score mined from twitter thread engagement.

## Reason for project
As organizations become increasingly reliant on Social Media platforms for customer engagement; customers have been given a voice to either complain or praise the efforts of these organizations.

Platforms such as **Twitter** have become increasingly rich in data as customers voluntarily voice their opinions and critique the behaviour and decisions that certain organizations decide to make.

Larger organizations with millions of followers will be bombarded with tweets at rates which are humanly impossible to read.
Therefore the full scope of how customers feel about their new announcement and/or decisions cannot be easily understood through human reading alone.

Feedback is important but it is only valuable when it is noticed, internalized and addressed.

## Aim

This project aims to retrieve and analyze tweets made to specific twitter threads, and the overall sentiment for the threads will be analyzed along with the most prevalent words associated with the positive and negative sentiments.
